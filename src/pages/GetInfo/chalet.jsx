      <h1>Chalet Inge</h1>
      <p className="introduction">
        This year we’ll stay at the catered chalet “Inge” in Sankt Anton. This
        is situated on a beautiful location just off the piste (number 24)
        leading to the Nasserein skilift.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll stay in the chalet for 3 nights (half pension), and breakfast and
        dinner is served here by the lovely people of Wens Chalets. Bed linen
        and towels are taken care of and all the snacks and drinks in the chalet
        are included (including beer &amp; wine). Some of the rooms feature a
        private bathroom, which is fitted with a bath tub or a shower and a
        balcony. There is a ski storage room and free private parking is
        possible on site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to join the “Looping Louie”-competition right after dinner, but
        after some beers you can visit some great bars nearby. Main town is only
        a short bus ride away - you can easily walk or get a taxi back at night
        too!
      </p>
