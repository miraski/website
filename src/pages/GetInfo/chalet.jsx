      <h1>Chalet Alber</h1>
      <p className="introduction">
        This year we’ll stay at the catered Chalet Alber in Sankt Anton.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chalet is situated on a beautiful location just off the piste
        (number 24) leading to the Nasserein skilift. You can ski back to the
        chalet, something that is rare for Sankt Anton accommodations. The ski
        lift is only 600 meters away, and at the end of the day it’s only a 250m
        walk from the Gampen slopes. Several hiking trails start directly on the
        doorstep. A toboggan run can be accessed in the immediate vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll stay in the chalet for 4 nights (half pension), and breakfast and
        dinner is served here by the lovely people of Wens Chalets. Bed linen
        and towels are taken care of and all the snacks and drinks in the chalet
        are included (including beer &amp; wine). All of the rooms feature a
        private bathroom, which is fitted with a bath tub or a shower and
        optionally a balcony. There is a ski storage room and free private
        parking is possible on site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to join the “Looping Louie”-competition right after dinner, but
        after some beers or jägers you can visit some great bars nearby. Main
        town is only a short bus ride away - you can easily walk or get a taxi
        back at night too!
